# pinbruteforce
code i used to brute force a 4 digit pin in a game, i also used an OCR to read the screen so the code stops automatically 
the "first_1000_numbers.py" is obviously for the first 1000 numbers and the "no.py" for the rest of the digits.
this code is really impractical because it takes like 2 seconds for number so...
but if you don't need it to stop automatically, you can delete the ocr/tesseract part
